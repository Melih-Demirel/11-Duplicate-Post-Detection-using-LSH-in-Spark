This means that the average time between decays assuming stationarity is an exponential random variable, with$$Pr[T_i&gt;t]=\\exp(-\\lambda t)$$for a constant $\\lambda.$If you know $\\lambda$ you can divide time into intervals of length $T_0$ such that $$\\exp(-\\lambda T_0)=1/2$$and output a one if there is a decay zero otherwise.There are many reasons this is probably too simplistic, plus the issue of the environmental interference (natural or malicious) with the source statistics.So just treat $\\lambda$ as unknown pick some $T_0$ by observing the source decay rate, and apply an unbiasing algorithm and then pass blocks of long enough output strings through a secure hash function to be sure.If the source decay rate changes significantly you can adjust $T_0.$\n",
      "102158 : Well, physical processes are not necessarily easy to control or to model; This is with respect to independence and uniformity of their output.Both your points are correct, and in fact it's not just a matter of being gaussian vs uniform. And these need to be processed as you pointed out, by extractors etc.It doesn't matter if the decay is quantum, the output is still not ideal and ready to use. And how confident can you be that there are no environmental processes that can interfere with a quantum generator?Just as an example, radioactive decay is normally measured by an exponential process assuming environment parameters are constant. This means that the average time between decays assuming stationarity is an exponential random variable, with$$Pr[T_i&gt;t]=\\exp(-\\lambda t)$$for a constant $\\lambda.$If you know $\\lambda$ you can divide time into intervals of length $T_0$ such that $$\\exp(-\\lambda T_0)=1/2$$and output a one if there is a decay zero otherwise.There are many reasons this is probably too simplistic, plus the issue of the environmental interference (natural or malicious) with the source statistics, as mentioned above.So it may be better to treat $\\lambda$ as unknown pick some $T_0$ by observing the source decay rate, and apply an unbiasing algorithm and then pass blocks of long enough output strings through a secure hash function to be sure.If the source decay rate changes significantly you can adjust $T_0.$\n",

I thought of a rather simplistic encryption method, and wondering what you people think of how (in)secure this is, compared to AES.I propose the following symmetric encryption method:Given any input data, and a password (each of arbitrary length), we encrypt the data as follows:H1 and H are hashing functions (e.g. SHA256 or SHA3-512). H1 and H may be the same.n1 and n are the number of bits of H1's and H's output (e.g. if H1=SHA3-512 then n1=512, and if H=SHA256 then n=256). Preferably n1≥n.S = a randomly generated salt of 128 bits, which is written at the start of the output.K = H1(S+password) where + means binary concatenation.The data is processed in blocks of n bits (the last block may be smaller).Block i is XOR'ed with B(i) = H(K XOR i) where i is the block index (starting at zero), represented as a simple binary integer, extended to n1 bits (to match K's size).If the last block is m &lt; n bits, only those m bits are procesed (the remaining n-m bits of the last B(i) are not used).The decryption procedure is basically the same, except S is taken from the encrypted data instead of generated.I would suggest H1 = scrypt, bcrypt, or PBKDF2 with moderate work parameters, and H = SHA256 or SHA3-256.Properties/advantages:It's a stream cipher. Every block of n bits can be encrypted and decrypted completely independent of other blocks. This makes the algorithm suitable for streaming, parallelization, and if part of the data is damaged or missing, the rest can still be decrypted (except if the salt at the beginning is corrupted). Additional data can be appended later, and parts of the existing data can be replaced in-place.Because of the random salt S, similar data encrypted with the same password will result in completely different outputs.Even if you happen to know part of the input data, nothing is revealed about the rest of the data or the password.It's fast, provided that H is fast.Encryption and decryption are the same (only difference is generating a random salt vs reading it).Other than the 128-bit salt, the encrypted data stays the same size (unlike certain other encryption algorithms, especially asymmetric).No padding involved that can be abused to tamper with the data or partial decrypting by trial and error (some other encryption schemes have padding vulnerabilities).\n",

In short terms it consists in generating an ECDSA signature using the point $R$ as generator, $s$ as private key and the result of $s*R$ as public key. So the $r$ part of the signature would be revealed but the $s$ part is still kept secret.The usual ECDSA signature generation consists in proving that given a point $Qa$ where $Qa = da*G$ you know the number $da$ without revealing it.To do so, the signing process works as following:step 1. The signer calculates a new point R such that $R = k*G$ and where $k$ is a nonce that needs to be changed for every new signature.step 2. The signer sets $r$ such that $r$ is the x coordinate of the point $R$Step 3. The signer calculates $m$ such that $m = HASH(message)$.Step 4. The signer calculates $s$ such that $s = k^{-1}(m+da*r)$Finally the signature are the values $(r,s)$The verification of the signature's authenticity is verified by ensuring that:$R = s^{-1}m*G + s^{-1}r*Qa$or that:$s*R = m*G + r*Qa$Multiplying this equation by a big secret number $x$ as you suggested would result in having:$(xs)*R = (xm)*G + (xr)*Qa$Although the verification of the equation is correct there are numerous traps that make it unsuitable to guarantee the authenticity without revealing $(r,s)$.

This is exactly what we already did with $Qa = da*G$!

The result is divided into n 512-bit blocks.http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/Tiger/tiger/node2.htmlI assume this 64 bit word is little endian, like the rest of Tiger and like the MD4 padding.For reference the RFC1320 which describes MD4 says:  a sequence of     bytes can be interpreted as a sequence of 32-bit words, where each     consecutive group of four bytes is interpreted as a word with the     low-order (least significant) byte given first.    [...]    Step 1. Append Padding Bits    The message is \"padded\" (extended) so that its length (in bits) is     congruent to 448, modulo 512.

Padding is always performed, even if the length of the message is     already congruent to 448, modulo 512.

Append Length    A 64-bit representation of b (the length of the message before the     padding bits were added) is appended to the result of the previous     step. In the unlikely event that b is greater than 2^64, then only     the low-order 64 bits of b are used. (These bits are appended as two     32-bit words and appended low-order word first in accordance with the     previous conventions.)    At this point the resulting message (after padding with bits and with     b) has a length that is an exact multiple of 512 bits.

The usual explanation is that they make implementation easier in some contexts, namely a hardware circuit which receives data over a 8-bit bus: it can accumulate the bits into eight shift registers, which is more efficient (in terms of circuit area) than a single 64-bit register. This process \"naturally\" performs the initial permutation of DES.In more details: Suppose that you are designing a hardware circuit which should do some encryption with DES, and receives data by blocks of 8 bits. This means that there are 8 \"lines\", each yielding one bit at each clock. A common device for accumulating data is a shift register: the input line plugs into a one-bit register, which itself plugs into another, which plugs into a third register, and so on. At each clock, each register receives the contents from the previous, and the first register accepts the new bit. Hence, the contents are \"shifted\".With an 8-bit bus, you would need 8 shift registers, each receiving 8 bits for an input block. The first register will receive bits 1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, 49 and 57. The second register receives bits 2, 10, 18,... and so on. After eight clocks, you have received the complete 64-bit block and it is time to proceed with the DES algorithm itself.If there was no initial permutation, then the first step of the first round would extract the \"left half\" (32 bits) which, at that point, would consist of the leftest 4 bits of each of the 8 shift registers. The \"right half\" would also get bits from the 8 shift registers. If you think of it as wires from the shift registers to the units which use the bits, then you end up with a bunch of wires which heavily cross each other. Crossing is doable but requires some circuit area, which is the expensive resource in hardware designs.However, if you consider that the wires must extract the input bits and permute them as per the DES specification, you will find out that there is no crossing anymore. In other words, the accumulation of bits into the shift registers inherently performs a permutation of the bits, which is exactly the initial permutation of DES. By defining that initial permutation, the DES standard says: \"well, now that you have accumulated the bits in eight shift registers, just use them in that order, that's fine\".The same thing is done again at the end of the algorithm.Remember that DES was designed at a time when 8-bit bus where the top of the technology, and one thousand transistors were an awfully expensive amount of logic.\n",

Those two people could try to combine their attributes to include \"manager\" and \"sales\", and then attempt to decrypt the message together.  ABE schemes prevent this type of collusion.  \n",

An answer before that is not expected; I'd just like to understand what the flaw is. From An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography By Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher and Joseph H. Silverman (Springer, 2008); problem 3.10, found one click away from here:  Alice chooses two large primes $p$ and $q$ and she publishes $N = pq$. It is assumed  that $N$ is hard to factor. Alice also chooses three random numbers $g$, $r_1$, and $r_2$ modulo $N$ and computes  $$g_1\\equiv g^{r_1\\cdot(p−1)}\\pmod N\\text{ }\\text{ and }\\text{ }g_2\\equiv g^{r_2\\cdot(q−1)}\\pmod N.$$    Her public key is the triple $(N,g_1,g_2)$ and her private key is the pair of primes $(p,q)$.    Now Bob wants to send the message $m$ to Alice, where $m$ is a number modulo $N$. He chooses two random integers $s_1$ and $s_2$ modulo $N$ and computes  $$c_1\\equiv m\\cdot{g_1}^{s_1}\\pmod N\\text{ }\\text{ and }\\text{ }c_2\\equiv m\\cdot{g_2}^{s_2}\\pmod N.$$  Bob sends the ciphertext $(c_1,c_2)$ to Alice.    Decryption is extremely fast and easy. Alice use the Chinese remainder theorem  to solve the pair of congruences  $$x\\equiv c_1\\pmod p\\text{ }\\text{ and }\\text{ }x\\equiv c_2\\pmod q.$$    (a) Prove that Alice’s solution $x$ is equal to Bob’s plaintext $m$.  (b) Explain why this cryptosystem is not secure.I can verify A but am having trouble seeing where the cryptosystem is weak.Avenues I've explored:The modulus is factorableThe encrypted text is easily decryptableBut I'm just not seeing the answer.

      "62218 : To implement a decentralized system, I wrote a TLS like P2P net stack.The main idea is removing CA Cert from the whole system by using a DHT for Naming and Key Exchange.I am not a crypto expert, so if there's any flaw please point it out for me here or Github.First, I use an Elliptic Curve for asymmetric encryption and AES-256-CBC for symmetric encryption.DH-RPC NodeID is generated by hashing the Node PublicKey and an Uint256 Nonce:NodeID := sha256(blake2b-512(NodePublicKey + Uint256Nonce))I refer to S/Kademlia's idea to define the number of consecutive 0s in front of the NodeID as difficulty and to impose a minimum limit on the difficulty of the NodeID allowed to be stored on the DHT.DHT is used to hold the NodeID:PublicKey NodeID:Addr map. NodeID and Nonce are sent to do ECDH getting shared secret after TCP connection established.GenECDHSharedSecret(APub, BPriv) == GenECDHSharedSecret(BPub, APriv)The main procedure is described in this sequence chart:Because in the decentralized system NodeID is the URI, not \"Bob/Alice.com\".

I am not a crypto expert, so if there's any flaw please point it out for me here or GithubFirst, I use an Elliptic Curve for asymmetric encryption and AES-256-CBC for symmetric encryption.DH-RPC NodeID is generated by hash of Node PublicKey and an Uint256 Nonce:NodeID := sha256(blake2b-512(NodePublicKey + Uint256Nonce))I refer to S/Kademlia's idea to define the number of consecutive 0s in front of the NodeID as difficulty and to impose a minimum limit on the difficulty of the NodeID allowed to be stored on the DHT.DHT is used to hold the NodeID:PublicKey NodeID:Addr map. NodeID and Nonce are sent to do ECDH getting shared secret after TCP connection established.GenECDHSharedSecret(APub, BPriv) == GenECDHSharedSecret(BPub, APriv)The main procedure is described as sequence chart: Because in the decentralized system NodeID is the URI, not \"Bob/Alice.com\". So anyone tries to fake NodeB by overwriting the address or public key on DHT without the private key of NodeB will be failed to get the correct shared secret.Github: https://github.com/CovenantSQL/CovenantSQL/tree/develop/rpcKnown issues:Add a random uint64 along with NodeID and Nonce sent to remote to add some random for the shared key.you may check my question and discussion here: Is my way safe to remove SSL CA Cert by DHT and PoW NodeID for a decentralized system?\n",

Essentially, one of the requirements for a Pseudo-random generator to be secure is that the probability of guessing the next bit in the string is less than 1/2 + a non-negligible epsilon (epsilon being any statistical advantage the computer has of guessing the next bit of the string due to insecurity in the PRG). In an example the professor uses, he states that the probability of guessing the next bit of output from the PRG is 1/2 + 1/1000 (the non negligible epsilon). How is 1/1000 non-negligible? I understand we're using computers with thousands of times faster processing power than a normal human brain, but that still means that a computer only has a 50.1% chance of guessing the correct bit. How can a computer leverage that tiny extra probability to crack a secret key?\n",

      "40036 : Permuted Choice 1 determines how an input block is loaded into C and D Registers:Permuted Choice 1 is selection permutation describing how to load C and D registers from 8 successive bytes of input key, noting the LSB is only used for parity. (The big endian bit in byte ordering is from IBM).Permuted Choice 2 determines which C and D Register bits are used as input to f(R,K):Permuted Choice 2 is also a selection permutation selecting two 24 bit values from each of the C and D 28 bit registers which are shifted according to the key schedule.The DES standard also defines which selected Key bits are associated with each S Box:This shows the E Permutation as values of R exclusive OR'd with selected key bits as input to the 8 S Boxes.The Key Schedule causes rotations in the C and D registers bringing different key bits into play in different rounds.The program keytab.c reproduces two tables from the Meyers Metyas book Cryptography.Invoking keytab -b will fill an input block with input block indexes for each position convert those locations to the appropriate locations in the C and D Registers, iterate the key schedule and produce the selected Key for each round through PC2 giving a list of Ks bits referencing the input block indexes:  Bit  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24  KS     1  10 51 34 60 49 17 33 57  2  9 19 42  3 35 26 25 44 58 59  1 36 27 18 41     2   2 43 26 52 41  9 25 49 59  1 11 34 60 27 18 17 36 50 51 58 57 19 10 33     3  51 27 10 36 25 58  9 33 43 50 60 18 44 11  2  1 49 34 35 42 41  3 59 17     4  35 11 59 49  9 42 58 17 27 34 44  2 57 60 51 50 33 18 19 26 25 52 43  1     5  19 60 43 33 58 26 42  1 11 18 57 51 41 44 35 34 17  2  3 10  9 36 27 50     6   3 44 27 17 42 10 26 50 60  2 41 35 25 57 19 18  1 51 52 59 58 49 11 34     7  52 57 11  1 26 59 10 34 44 51 25 19  9 41  3  2 50 35 36 43 42 33 60 18     8  36 41 60 50 10 43 59 18 57 35  9  3 58 25 52 51 34 19 49 27 26 17 44  2     9  57 33 52 42  2 35 51 10 49 27  1 60 50 17 44 43 26 11 41 19 18  9 36 59    10  41 17 36 26 51 19 35 59 33 11 50 44 34  1 57 27 10 60 25  3  2 58 49 43    11  25  1 49 10 35  3 19 43 17 60 34 57 18 50 41 11 59 44  9 52 51 42 33 27    12   9 50 33 59 19 52  3 27  1 44 18 41  2 34 25 60 43 57 58 36 35 26 17 11    13  58 34 17 43  3 36 52 11 50 57  2 25 51 18  9 44 27 41 42 49 19 10  1 60    14  42 18  1 27 52 49 36 60 34 41 51  9 35  2 58 57 11 25 26 33  3 59 50 44    15  26  2 50 11 36 33 49 44 18 25 35 58 19 51 42 41 60  9 10 17 52 43 34 57    16  18 59 42  3 57 25 41 36 10 17 27 50 11 43 34 33 52  1  2  9 44 35 26 49    Bit 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48  KS     1  22 28 39 54 37  4 47 30  5 53 23 29 61 21 38 63 15 20 45 14 13 62 55 31     2  14 20 31 46 29 63 39 22 28 45 15 21 53 13 30 55  7 12 37  6  5 54 47 23     3  61  4 15 30 13 47 23  6 12 29 62  5 37 28 14 39 54 63 21 53 20 38 31  7     4  45 55 62 14 28 31  7 53 63 13 46 20 21 12 61 23 38 47  5 37  4 22 15 54     5  29 39 46 61 12 15 54 37 47 28 30  4  5 63 45  7 22 31 20 21 55  6 62 38     6  13 23 30 45 63 62 38 21 31 12 14 55 20 47 29 54  6 15  4  5 39 53 46 22     7  28  7 14 29 47 46 22  5 15 63 61 39  4 31 13 38 53 62 55 20 23 37 30  6     8  12 54 61 13 31 30  6 20 62 47 45 23 55 15 28 22 37 46 39  4  7 21 14 53     9   4 46 53  5 23 22 61 12 54 39 37 15 47  7 20 14 29 38 31 63 62 13  6 45    10  55 30 37 20  7  6 45 63 38 23 21 62 31 54  4 61 13 22 15 47 46 28 53 29    11  39 14 21  4 54 53 29 47 22  7  5 46 15 38 55 45 28  6 62 31 30 12 37 13    12  23 61  5 55 38 37 13 31  6 54 20 30 62 22 39 29 12 53 46 15 14 63 21 28    13   7 45 20 39 22 21 28 15 53 38  4 14 46  6 23 13 63 37 30 62 61 47  5 12    14  54 29  4 23  6  5 12 62 37 22 55 61 30 53  7 28 47 21 14 46 45 31 20 63    15  38 13 55  7 53 20 63 46 21  6 39 45 14 37 54 12 31  5 61 30 29 15  4 47    16  30  5 47 62 45 12 55 38 13 61 31 37  6 29 46  4 23 28 53 22 21  7 63 39  These represent Table 3-10 First Set of 24 key Bits in K(i), the Key used at Round( i) and Table 3-11 Second Set of 24 Key Bits in K(i), the Key Used at Round(i) found in Chapter 3. The Data Encryption standard the section Description of the Data Encryption Standard and subsection Generation of Key Vectors Used for Each Round of DES, of Cryptography A new Dimension in Computer Data Security subtitled A Guide for the Design and Implementation of Secure Systems, by Carl H. Meyer and Stephen M. Matyas published in 1982.The tables demonstrate the Permuted Choice 2 selected C and D register contents given in input block indexes for the 16 rounds of DES.The KS bits tell us which S Boxes each input block key bit is used on in each round. Note that for input block bit 1 (the most significant bit of the first byte of key) is used as input to S Boxes 1 through 4 in 14 rounds.Taking in to account e-suishi's comment the answer is achievable through research either reading or applied practice.  You could also note the process undertaken by the keytab program matches that described by fgrieu's comment.In this case keytab generates the schedule key for each of the 16 rounds by providing an integer value representing the input block index instead of a 1 or 0 representing a binary value. The idea comes from the original BSD libcrypt implementation of DES (des0.tar.gz, file crypt.c) which used integers to represent individual bits.Doing algorithm-design or cryptanalysis can imply validating what you read. \n",
